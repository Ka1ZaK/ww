# Script for Pywal with automatic selection of wallpapers from a folder or selecting them randomly. The script updates the configs of programs that cannot automatically load changes.

Posted it on Git for safekeeping.

mv ww /bin/ or mv ww /sbin/
```
## For use

After that script update your colors,wallpapers, and configs with compaitable programs.

In the next updates I will expand the number of programs with which the script works. Iâ€™ll also write an auto-installer, and the choice of the wallpaper folder on the first start soon.
