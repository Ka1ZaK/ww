# Script for Pywal with automatic selection of wallpapers from a folder or selecting them yourself. The script updates the configs of programs that cannot automatically load changes. 
## Works with:
```
Alacritty terminal
wal-telegram(aur)
Dunst
Firefox
Waybar
Xresources
```
Posted it on Git for safekeeping.

To change the default wallpaper directory, change WALLPAPDER_DIR 

## To install 
```
mv ww /bin/ or mv ww /sbin/
```
## For use
```
ww in terminal
```

After that script update your colors,wallpapers, and configs with compaitable programs.

In the next updates I will expand the number of programs with which the script works. Iâ€™ll also write an auto-installer, and the choice of the wallpaper folder on the first start soon.
